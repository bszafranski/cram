<h1>Creating a Network<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In its simplest form, a CRAM network consists of a single node with one inflow and one demand.  The inflow specifies the amount of water entering the system and the demand specifies the amount of water leaving the system.  Because CRAM enforces mass-balance, all of the flow entering through the Inflow must exit through the Demand. If the demand has been constrained to a capacity less than the Inflow flow found in one of the minor time steps the model will determine that an infeasible solution has occured.</p>
<p>Most Excel CRAM models will consist of a few hundred nodes connected by a larger number of links allowing water (flow) to be delivered to many different competing demands from a variety of sources. CRAM optimizes the system to determine the most efficient use of the water given the delivery constraints (both physical and administrative). After a solution has been attained, the user may want to experiment with additional stresses, constraints, or options on the simulation network. This is a core component of CRAM’s scenario analysis.</p>
<p>The modeling tool supports reservoirs, instream flows, decrees, and return flows which can greatly increase the complexity of models. CRAM’s operation steps allow modeling of the most complex exchanges and water rights. Please read the additional information about these features to be aware of “gotchas” that you may encounter when using the Excel CRAM modeling tool. The blue note boxes provide tips that may be helful in avoiding modeling errors (infeasible solutions).</p>
<div class="section" id="adding-a-node">
<h2>Adding a Node<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-node" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nodes are the basic building block of a CRAM network. Nodes are used to connect other network arc types (e.g., links, inflows, demands) and help determine the potential paths for flow in the model. There are two kinds of nodes in a model.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>General nodes are nodes that have a single instance and physical location in the model.  You can identify a general node because it will be represented by a circle with a number inside of it.</li>
<li>Special case nodes are related to mass balance. In each CRAM model there is one mass-balance node, but in the network diagrams (see The Network Schematic) it is represented in multiple locations. However, they all represent the same node in the model. For instance an inflow arc is attached from a mass balance node, while a demand arc is attached going-to a mass balance node. Mass balance nodes in the network schematic an be identified by the MB prefix before the node number. The MB node number is irrelevant, and simply used for book keeping.</li>
</ol>
<p>All nodes in the network maintain mass balance during every step of the solution.</p>
<p>To add a node to the network click on the Create Node button on the toolbar (shown below) or click on the Excel CRAM-&gt;Network-&gt;Add Object… menu item and select Node from the object type dropdown box.</p>

<p>The basic features necessary to add a model node are discussed in this section. Here we step through the fields on the <strong>Edit Node</strong> dialog box.</p>
<img alt="_images/edit-node.png" src="_images/edit-node.png" />
<p>The <strong>Node Number</strong> is automatically assigned by Excel CRAM. Nodes can not be reused in the network.</p>
<p><strong>The Node Name</strong> is user-defined, and is typically left blank. If the Node Name is used, it must be an ASCII string (alphanumeric and/or special characters). A good example for a node name would be a stream gage name, location, or other geographic reference.</p>

<h2>Adding a Link<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-link" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A link connects two nodes. It has four user configurable parameters which help determine the amount of flow passing from the “From Node” to the “To Node” in the model. The four parameters are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>High:</strong> The High parameter is the maximum amount of flow that can pass through the link in a single solution time step. Typically the default value of “Infinite” is used. However, integer values are commonly used to represent pipeline capacities.</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last"><strong>Advanced Note:</strong> <em>If the total amount of water at the From Node is greater than the sum of all High parameters on all arcs leaving that node, an infeasible solution will occur. Using the default value of “infinite” avoids this problem.</em></p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><strong>Low:</strong>  The Low parameter is the minimum amount of flow that MUST pass through the link in a single solution time step. Typically the default value of “0” is used.</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last"><em>If the Low is set higher than the High parameter, an infeasible solution will occur.  If the From Node for this link does not have as much flow into it as the sum of all of the Low parameters leaving that node, an infeasible solution will occur.</em></p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><strong>Priority:</strong>  The Priority parameter helps the network to determine the relative priority of sending water through a link.  Priorities (or ranks) in the network model are additive.</li>

<div class="admonition note">

<h2>Adding an Inflow<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-an-inflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inflows provide the source of water for an Excel CRAM network. Once in the model the water (flow) is divided up among the demands based on the total priority of routing, from the inflow to the bottom of the network. Behind the scense, the model “circulates” the water using the mass balance nodes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An inflow can be connected TO any node (except a mass balance node)</li>
<li>An inflow will always be connected FROM the mass balance node</li>
</ul>
<p>Inflows only have one parameter, Flow.  For Inflows, the Flow defines both the High and the Low on the arc. If the Flow from an inflow is not able to find a route through the network and back to the mass balance node an infeasible solution will occur.</p>
