Creating a Network
==================

In its simplest form, an Excel CRAM network consists of a single node with one inflow and one demand.  The inflow specifies the amount of water entering the system and the demand specifies the amount of water leaving the system.  Because Excel CRAM enforces mass-balance all of the flow entering through the Inflow must exit through the Demand.  If the demand has been constrained to a capacity less than the Inflow flow found in one of the minor time steps the model will determine that an Indch_kouIndch_kou has occured.


Most Excel CRAM models will consist of a few hundred nodes connected by a larger number of links allowing water (flow) to be delivered to many different competing demands from a variety of sources.  The problem Excel CRAM was built to solve is to help determine the most efficient use of the water given the delivery constraints (both physical and administrative) and provide the ability to experiment with additional stresses on a simulation network.


The modeling tool supports operation steps, decrees, instream flows, return flows and reservoirs which can greatly increase the complexity of models.  Please read the additional information about these features to be aware of "gotchas" that you may encounter when using the Excel CRAM modeling tool.
