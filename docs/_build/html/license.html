<ol class="upperroman simple">
<li>GRANT OF LICENSE</li>
</ol>

<ol class="upperroman simple" start="2">
<li>DESCRIPTION OF SOFTWARE</li>
</ol>

<ol class="upperroman simple" start="3">
<li>COPYRIGHT PROTECTION</li>
</ol>
<p>The Software contains proprietary trade secrets owned by Lynker and is protected by United States Copyright Law.  Nothing in this License or in the provision and support of the Software by Lynker shall be construed as a transfer of any copyright or ownership interest in the Software from Lynker to the licensee. Licensee owns the magnetic or other physical medium on which the Software is originally or subsequently recorded or fixed, but Lynker retains title and ownership of the Software recorded on the original disk copy(ies) and all subsequent copies of the Software, regardless of the form or media in or on which the original and other copies may exist. This License is not a sale of the original Software or any copy.</p>
<p>The trade secrets contained in the Software are valuable to Lynker and their use and disclosure must be carefully controlled. With certain exceptions described below, the Licensee shall not engage in any copying or distribution of the Software without the express written consent of Lynker. Lynker retains the right to injunctive relief enjoining any unauthorized copying and distribution of the Software.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="4">
<li>TERMS, RESTRICTIONS, AND EXCEPTIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>The term of this license begins upon delivery of the Software to the Licensee.</p>
<p>This License specifically prohibits the use of the Software for any purposes other than that described in the Grant of License.  The Licensee may use the software only for its own purposes and may not use the Software to perform work on behalf of others for cash payment or in return for services.  the Licensee may not resell the Software or any services which are dependent upon the use of the Software.</p>
<p>The Licensee may maintain one copy of the Software on a removable medium disk for an archive or backup for the sole purpose of protecting it against inadvertent loss.  Use of the Software shall, without exception, be bound by all the terms and conditions of this license.</p>
<p>The Licensee may not adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Software; nor may the Licensee adapt, translate, or create derivative works based on the written materials without the prior written consent of Hydrosphere.</p>
<p>The Licensee is prohibited from transferring the Software to anyone without the prior written consent of Lynker.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any authorized transferee of the Software shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Licensee shall notify Lynker immediately of any unauthorized copying or possession of the Software that is brought to its attention.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="22">
<li>TERMINATION</li>
</ol>
<p>This License is effective until terminated.  This License will terminate automatically without notice from Lynker if the Licensee fails to comply with any provision of this License.  Upon termination of this License, the Licensee shall return all copies of the Software in its possession to Lynker and shall notify any and all authorized transferees that this License has been terminated and that all copies of the Software in the possession of said transferees should be returned to Lynker.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="6">
<li>INDEMNIFICATION</li>
</ol>
<p>The Licensee recognizes that the conversion of the Software from the computing system and format on which it may be installed by Lynker, at the time of delivery of the Software to the Licensee, to an alternate system or format may result in the introduction of errors and anomalies.  In the event the Software is so converted subsequent to acceptance by the Licensee, the Licensee assumes all risks associated therewith and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to hold harmless and indemnify Lynker against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, and costs, including but not limited to attorney’s fees, arising therefrom.</p>
<p>The Licensee recognizes that use of or modifications of the Software or the data files it uses by anyone other than Lynker may result in adverse consequences which Lynker can neither predict nor control. Therefore, in consideration of Lynker’s agreement to deliver the Software, the Licensee agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to hold harmless and indemnify Lynker from and against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, and costs, including but not limited to attorney’s fees, arising out of or in any way connected with the use, modification, misinterpretation, misuse, or reuse of the Software provided by Lynker under this agreement. The foregoing indemnification applies to any use of the Software other than for any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, and costs, including but not limited to attorney’s fees, arising out of or in any way connected with infringement of patent rights, copyrights, trademarks, or any other proprietary rights.</p>
<p>Because of the possibility that, after delivery thereof, the Software may be altered, whether inadvertently or otherwise, Lynker reserves the right to retain copies of the Software as originally delivered, which originals shall be referred to and shall govern in the event of any inconsistency between the two.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="7">
<li>LIMITED WARRANTY</li>
</ol>
<p>Lynker warrants the physical diskette(s) and physical documentation to be free of defects in materials and workmanship for a period of 60 days from the date of delivery. In the event of notification within this warranty period, Lynker will replace the defective diskette or documentation. The remedy for breach of this warranty shall be limited to replacement and shall not encompass any other damages of any kind.</p>
<p>In no case shall Lynker’s liability under the terms of this agreement exceed the License fee paid to Lynker by the Licensee.</p>
<p>Lynker specifically disclaims all other warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the use, or the results of the use, of the Software on any machines other than those described above or by anyone other than Lynker. This disclaimer extends to written materials in terms of correctness, accuracy, reliability, currentness, and otherwise. The entire risk as to the results and performance of the Software, once delivered, is assumed by the Licensee.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="8">
<li>ARBITRATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Any controversy or claim between Lynker and the Licensee arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or its performance or breach and any claims of negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or misrepresentation related to it, but excluding actions for injunctive relief to enforce Section III, shall be settled by arbitration in Boulder, Colorado, in accordance with Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association; and judgment entered upon award by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
