TO DO List

1. Add favicon to Website tab
According to sphinx read the docs documentation:
This is added to the "html_theme_options" in conf.py

https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme/blob/master/docs/conf.py
# The name of an image file (within the static path) to use as favicon of the
# docs.  This file should be a Windows icon file (.ico) being 16x16 or 32x32
# pixels large.
#html_favicon = None

Theme options are theme-specific and customize the look and feel of a theme
# further.  For a list of options available for each theme, see the
# documentation.
html_theme_options = {
    'logo_only': True
}


2. Add Logo/Picture to Sidebar
Instead of it just saying CRAM, in can be a CRAM image/logo.
For inspiration, see how Read the Docs has done this on their page:
